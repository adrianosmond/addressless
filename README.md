# Addressless

Source for [Upside Down & Addressless](https://addressless.co.uk), a blog I made to a) document our 3 month trip in New Zealand and b) play with React. It started with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The design is mine.

## Further work

I started to put Redux in but didn't have time to finish before our flights (it's in the public facing parts but is missing from the editor section). It wasn't practical to do any serious coding out of our campervan, so it remains in a half way house. The benefits of the keeping data in the store were good enough to make it worth rolling out to the live version. Maybe I'll finish it up at some point. I'd also love to plot the posts on the map and show a timeline of the trip now that it's over :'(
